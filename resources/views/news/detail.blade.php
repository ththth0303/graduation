                <p>For quite sometime now, I have been hearing some very interesting things about react.js like how fast it is and how cool it would be to pick react.js for your next web project. All that sounds very good but, unless we try it ourself, we won't be able to appreaciate it. So I decided to play with react.js for a while and see myself how accurate these claims are. Now there is just one problem, react.js documentation assumes certain level of experience with modern Javascript developement workflow, in short let's just say it's not very helpful if you are trying to use it for the first time. This series of articles is my attempt to put all the pieces together and show what it will take to build a fully functional react app. </p>
